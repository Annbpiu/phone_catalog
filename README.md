# React Phone Catalog Project

I developed a responsive and user-friendly phone catalog application using modern web development technologies. The project showcases a variety of phones with detailed information, and it includes features like sorting, filtering, and the ability to save favorite items. Key technologies and tools used in this project include:

 - React: Leveraged React to build a dynamic and interactive UI, utilizing functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for efficient state management.
 - TypeScript: Applied TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability, ensuring robust and predictable application behavior.
 - React Router: Implemented navigation across pages (e.g., product details and category pages), providing a seamless user experience with client-side routing.
 - localStorage: Enabled persistent data storage for user preferences, such as saved favorite items, which remain accessible across sessions.
 - SCSS: Created a custom and modular style using SCSS, including color variables and nested styles to maintain a clean and scalable design system.
 - Build Tool (Webpack or Vite): Used a bundler to optimize assets for faster load times and efficient deployment, enhancing the app's overall performance.
 - GitHub Pages: Deployed the app on GitHub Pages for public access, allowing users to interact with a live demo of the application.
 - classnames Library: Utilized the classnames library to conditionally apply CSS classes, improving the maintainability of style-related logic within components.

This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive, scalable, and maintainable front-end applications, combining design and functionality to deliver a high-quality user experience.
